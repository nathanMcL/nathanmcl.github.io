# Lab Tool Box (01/07/2026)

Starting with `Nmap`, each additional *"tool"* should have it's *own* container.  

## Service Container:

- `Nmap`  to show what is running inside the container
-  
-  

## Nmap: Live Host Discovery

## Nmap

What is `Nmap` or `Zenmap`? From a simple google search you can see the following: 

`Nmap` is used through the terminal/command line.  
`Zenmap` is a `Graphical User Interface` (GUI) that provides the user with a visual interface to interact with.  

- `Host Discovery`: Identifies which devices (hosts, servers, routers, switches) are online and reachable on a network.
- `Port Scanning`: Determines the state of ports on a target device (open, closed, or filtered by a firewall), which helps identify potential entry points for attackers.
- `Service` and `Version` Detection: Probes open ports to identify the application and specific software version of the service running on them. This helps in detecting outdated or vulnerable software.
- `Operating System` (OS) Detection: Analyzes network responses using TCP/IP stack fingerprinting to determine the OS (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS) and hardware characteristics of the remote host.
- `Vulnerability` Detection: The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) allows users to run scripts to automate various tasks, including checking for specific known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and backdoors.
- `Network Inventory` and `Monitoring`: Network administrators use Nmap for routine tasks like asset management, monitoring server uptime, and ensuring security compliance.
Usage
- `Nmap` is primarily a `command-line interface` (CLI) tool available for **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**. A graphical user interface (GUI) version called `Zenmap` is also available to help beginners visualize and interact with scan results.

`Nmap` is a powerful tool used by security professionals and ethical hackers for defensive purposes, ***BUT*** it can also be used by *malicious actors* for `reconnaissance`. `Unauthorized scanning` of networks may be **illegal**, so it should ***only*** be used on `your own network` or with **explicit permission** from the network owner (In writing).
